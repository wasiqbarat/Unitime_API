# Unitime Solver API

A REST API wrapper around the [CPSolver](https://github.com/UniTime/cpsolver) library for university timetabling and scheduling.

## Overview

Unitime Solver API provides a modern REST interface to the powerful CPSolver Java library, enabling easy integration of timetabling functionality into web applications and other services. It handles course scheduling, room assignment, and timetable optimization for educational institutions.

## Features

- REST API for university timetabling operations
- Seamless integration with the CPSolver library
- Input validation and error handling
- Asynchronous solution processing
- Solution persistence and retrieval

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
- CPSolver library and its dependencies

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/unitime-api.git
cd unitime-api
```

2. Install required Python packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Ensure the CPSolver directory is available in one of the following locations:
   - `./cpsolver`
   - `../cpsolver`
   - Or set the `SOLVER_PATH` environment variable to the CPSolver directory

## Setup

Run the setup script to verify your installation:

```bash
python setup_cpsolver.py
```

The script will check for:
- CPSolver directory presence
- Required JAR files
- Java installation
- Create necessary output directories

## Running the API

Start the API server with:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

## API Endpoints

### General Endpoints
- `GET /` - Health check endpoint

### Legacy Solver Control
- `POST /solver/start` - Start the test solver
- `GET /solver/status` - Get solver status 
- `POST /solver/stop` - Stop the solver

### Problem Management Endpoints
- `POST /problems` - Submit a problem in JSON format
- `POST /problems/xml` - Submit a problem in XML format
- `GET /problems/{problem_id}` - Get problem status
- `DELETE /problems/{problem_id}` - Cancel a problem solver process
- `GET /problems/{problem_id}/solution` - Get problem solution in JSON format
- `GET /problems/{problem_id}/solution/xml` - Get problem solution in XML format

### Solution Retrieval

The API provides two formats for retrieving solutions:

#### JSON Format
```
GET /problems/{problem_id}/solution
```

Returns a structured JSON representation of the solution, with:
- Solution metadata (solver, version, runtime)
- Statistics from the solver
- Class assignments with:
  - Time slots in human-readable format (e.g., "9:30 AM")
  - Room assignments
  - Day information

#### XML Format
```
GET /problems/{problem_id}/solution/xml
```

Returns the raw XML solution as generated by the CPSolver, useful for:
- Systems that need the original format
- Debugging solver output
- Integration with UniTime components

## API Documentation

Once running, access the auto-generated API documentation at:
- Swagger UI: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- ReDoc: `http://localhost:8000/redoc`

## Environment Variables

- `SOLVER_PATH`: Path to the CPSolver directory (optional)
- `LOG_LEVEL`: Set logging level (default: INFO)

## Docker Support

A Dockerfile is provided for containerized deployment:

```bash
docker build -t unitime-api .
docker run -p 8000:8000 -v /path/to/cpsolver:/app/cpsolver unitime-api
```

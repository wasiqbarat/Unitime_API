"""
Data models for the Unitime solver API integration.

This module defines Pydantic models that:
- Represent the structure of requests and responses
- Validate input data for solver operations
- Define the schema for course timetabling data
- Map between API models and Unitime solver formats

These models enable type safety and data validation throughout the application.
